        <p> Hello! I am glad to have you learn a little about me. I am from Abuja, Nigeria. I am unmarried. I am the last of 4 children, and I get to enjoy all the perks of being the last born.</p>
        <p> I have always been drawn to technogy, starting with the obssesion to fix every spoilt appliance in the house.I have always been curious on how computers get to do what they do and how my favorite video game was created. 
          That definatly impacted on my choice to get on this path to becoming a programmer.I am currently pursuing a degree in applied technology.</p>
        <p> I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day saints all my life, and having to study among people of the same faith and belifs is a big plus to my educational journey. 
          I am excited to have to share my projects with you. I hope they turn out great.</p>
