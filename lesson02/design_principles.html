            <p>Apple's website is one example of a brand website that commonly uses the rule of white space and clean design. Apple is well-known for its minimalistic and elegant design, and their website is a great example of this. There is often a lot of white space, simple font, high-quality pictures, and an emphasis on the products that Apple offers on their website, resulting in a neat and user-friendly design. The items are at the forefront of the design, which is focused on functionality and ease of use. The website provides a straightforward, modern, and easy-to-navigate user experience..</p>

            <p>The website of the well-known brand Nike frequently incorporates the rule of thirds in its design. The rule of thirds is a composition principle that partitions an image or layout into nine equal parts with two parallel horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines, creating a grid. This guideline is useful for establishing symmetry and visual harmony in a layout.  Typically, Nike's website is composed of graphics and material that are positioned in accordance with the rule of thirds, contributing to a balanced and aesthetically appealing design. The rule of thirds' grid provides a framework for emphasizing specific components within the layout and creating visual cohesion.</p>

            <p>Amazon's website successfully balances its extensive selection of goods and information by offering distinct visual indicators, simple navigation, and compelling calls to action. This empowers customers to quickly locate and purchase the items they need. The layout is clear and straightforward, with clear categories and subcategories, search bars, and recommendations. The visual design is simple and straightforward, focusing on product images, ratings, and prices. This allows users to quickly scan the website and make purchasing decisions. The "Buy Now" buttons are prominent and easy to spot, encouraging users to complete their purchases.</p>
